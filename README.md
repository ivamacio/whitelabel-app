# whitelabel-app
Proof of concept that demonstrates some features to white-label an android app.

You can expect to see in this project:
* Three different build flavours (*companyOne*, *companyTwo* and *defaultCompany*)
* custom *applicationId* using *applicationIdSuffix*
* *custom_colours.xml* file inside of the specific build flavours, so we can customize its colours
* *custom_strings.xml* file inside of the specific build flavours, so we can customize its strings
